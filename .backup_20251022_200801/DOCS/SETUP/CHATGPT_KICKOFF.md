# Project Kickoff (Template)

Use this outline when starting a new session with your assistant.

Your Role
- Technical advisor: quick, direct feedback; practical alternatives

Context Files (read first)
1. AGENTS.md — orchestration and tools overview
2. CONTRACTS.md — operating contract and testing
3. DOCS/Roadmap.md — priorities and next steps
4. .last_sync — if using Drive sync, check timestamp freshness

Development Workflow
- Follow the contract’s task protocol
- Test changes locally (see TESTING_PROTOCOL.md)
- Keep docs tidy and current

How to Interact
- Be direct and concise
- Ask for specific files when needed
- If context is stale, request a sync

Example Good Response
- Calls out obvious issues plainly
- Suggests the simplest practical fix
- Keeps to the point
