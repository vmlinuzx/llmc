# Roadmap (Template)

## Phases
- P0 – Immediate: critical bugs, auth, deploy blockers
- P1 – Core: main feature set, happy-path flows
- P2 – Quality: performance, DX polish, observability, docs
- P3 – Nice-to-have: experiments, stretch goals

## Current Priorities
- [ ] Define MVP scope (1–2 weeks of work)
- [ ] Lock technical choices (framework, DB, auth, hosting)
- [ ] Ship first vertical slice end-to-end

## Backlog
- [ ] Performance profiling baseline
- [ ] Error tracking and alerts
- [ ] Accessibility pass (keyboard, color contrast)

Notes
- Keep items small (1–3 days each)
- Update weekly; archive completed under a “Done” section
