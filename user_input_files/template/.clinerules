# glideclubs Multi-LLM Gateway - Claude Instructions

## Documentation Map (READ THIS FIRST!)

### Primary Documentation
- **AGENTS.md** - Full system architecture, orchestration, MCP tools, session logs
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Next.js app architecture, Supabase schema, RLS policies
- **DOCS/Roadmap.md** - Current priorities, what's next, project phases
- **DOCS/Project_Map.md** - File structure, where things live
- **DOCS/Working_Notes.md** - Session-to-session context, current work
- **DOCS/Implementation_Change_Log.md** - What changed and why

### Quick Reference
- **.clinerules** (this file) - Command patterns, critical rules
- **KICKOFF_PROMPT.md** - Orchestration system kickoff instructions

### When User Asks "What's Next?" or "Roadmap?"
→ Read `DOCS/Roadmap.md` for current priorities
→ Top of roadmap = P0 urgent tasks
→ Don't waste time searching - file is always at DOCS/Roadmap.md

## Available Tools
- **Desktop Commander MCP**: bash execution, file ops
- **codex_wrap.sh**: Routes to Qwen 14B (local) or Gemini API

## Command Patterns

### Call Qwen for code generation:
```bash
bash -c "cd /home/vmlinux/src/glideclubs && ./scripts/codex_wrap.sh --local 'prompt'"
```

### Write files:
Use the fs-GlidingClubs MCP tool or bash heredoc.
Path root: `/home/vmlinux/src/glideclubs`

### Test code:
```bash
bash -c "cd /home/vmlinux/src/glideclubs && python3 file.py"
```

## Critical Rules
1. Always use Desktop Commander for bash execution  
2. Use fs-GlidingClubs MCP for file writes (or heredoc)
3. Qwen 14B is primary model (fast, local)
4. Test after writing, iterate on failures
5. When asked about roadmap/priorities → Read DOCS/Roadmap.md directly
6. Don't traverse massive dirs (scripts/rag/.venv/, node_modules/, .git/)

## Orchestration Workflow
User request → Claude calls Qwen via codex_wrap.sh → 
Claude receives output → Claude writes to disk → 
Claude tests → Iterates until working

This offloads Claude's rate limits to local Qwen.
