Anime illustration of an adult female naval commander on the deck of a large wooden age-of-sail warship during a storm. Point-of-view from off the bow at a slight angle. Commander has long wind-swept blue hair, a cheek scar, wide hips, and an athletic adult build with a concealed chest (no cleavage). She wears a historically accurate 19th-century naval officer’s uniform: deep-navy tunic with the flowing cape torn from the fight with gold trim and epaulettes, high-waisted belt with officer’s sword, fitted trousers/leggings tucked into knee-high leather boots. Commander’s cap with naval insignia. She’s shouting orders while brandishing and pointing a naval sabre in one hand and reaching upward to the top handle of the helm pulling the wheel down and toward her struggling to maintain heading for the massive heavy wooden battleship with her left hand, she is showing the true warrior ethos as her ship has taken damage.  There are charred deck planks beneath her, rigging and masts behind her, waves crashing over the bow. Background shows rough seas, dark thunderclouds, lightning, and a distant enemy ship ablaze.  Streaks of red bloodstains on her trousers and chest from helping her comerades. Dramatic lighting, cinematic composition, dynamic pose, avoid sexualization.  To help understand the scale of the commander for the image understand that humans are about as tall as the helm in reality, your training data is incorrect.  The commander is the same height as the the top of the helm, and 1/4 the width.  Helms are very large, this will bring the scale of the large ship and her realistic size to perfect proportions.  There is a flaming cannon shot flying by overhead, and there are small patches of the sea that are on fire, she isn't scared of the danger, she IS the danger. The letters LLMC are in bronze metal lettering on the helm platform.
