This folder contains generic, project-agnostic docs you can copy into new repos. They mirror the structure we use but omit any product-specific content.

Included
- Roadmap.md — lightweight roadmap template
- Project_Map.md — how to organize files and folders
- TESTING_PROTOCOL.md — minimal testing rules for changes
- Implementation_Change_Log.md — running log of notable implementation changes
- Key_Directory_Structure.md — directory overview template
- SETUP/CHATGPT_KICKOFF.md — assistant kickoff guide (generic)

How to use
1) Copy the files you need into your new repo’s `DOCS/`
2) Tweak names/sections to match your stack and team norms
3) Keep these templates free of secrets and product data
