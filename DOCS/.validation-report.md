## Changes Made This Run

### Fixed / Updated
1.  **`DOCS/getting-started/first-project.md`**
    -   Standardized on `llmc-cli` command (replaced `llmc`).
2.  **`DOCS/operations/index.md`**
    -   Corrected `llmc-cli doctor` to `llmc-cli debug doctor`.
3.  **`DOCS/operations/daemon.md`**
    -   Corrected `llmc debug doctor` to `llmc-cli debug doctor`.
    -   Clarified daemon status check command.
4.  **`DOCS/architecture/enrichment-hardening.md`**
    -   Updated legacy references (`llmc-rag-service` -> `llmc-cli service`).

### Created / Populated (Was Empty)
5.  **`DOCS/operations/monitoring.md`**
    -   Added content on service monitoring, metrics, and health checks.
6.  **`DOCS/architecture/rag-engine.md`**
    -   Added architecture overview of the RAG engine components.
7.  **`DOCS/development/testing.md`**
    -   Added guide for running tests (unit, RAG, security).
8.  **`DOCS/development/agent-contracts.md`**
    -   Added pointers to `AGENTS.md` and core protocols.

## Flagged for Human Review

1.  **`DOCS/getting-started/installation.md`**
    -   References `llmcwrapper` for pipx installation. Verified this matches expected behavior but worth a manual check.
2.  **`DOCS/user-guide/tui/index.md`**
    -   Contains a TODO: "Phase 3b or existing CONFIG_TUI.md will be migrated here".
3.  **`DOCS/reference/cli/llmc-rag-*.md`**
    -   These files are correctly marked DEPRECATED. Consider removing them in a future release.
