### ⚠️ Documents Needing Updates
- `DOCS/getting-started/installation.md`
  - Issue: Troubleshooting section says "Command not found: llmc" but should be "llmc-cli".
  - Fix Applied: Flagged for correction.
- `DOCS/user-guide/cli-reference.md`
  - Issue: Missing top-level `repo` command group (register/rm/clean/nukerag/validate). Shows only `service repo` subgroup.
  - Issue: `llmc-cli service repo add/remove` documented, but implementation for `service repo` is `add/remove/list`. (This is actually correct in doc, but confusingly different from top-level `repo register/rm`).
  - Fix Applied: Flagged for correction.

### 🔴 Critical Issues

## Changes Made This Run
- None yet.

## Flagged for Human Review
1. `DOCS/user-guide/cli-reference.md`: The CLI structure has a duality (`llmc repo` vs `llmc service repo`). The reference guide mostly ignores `llmc repo` top-level commands which are "full features" according to help. This needs a section added.
