### ⚠️ Documents Updated

  - Fix Applied: Updated commands to `llmc-cli`.

- `DOCS/reference/cli/llmc-cli.md`
  - Issue: Missing `test` command in output.
  - Fix Applied: Added `test` command to example output.
- `DOCS/index.md`

## Flagged for Human Review
- `DOCS/ARCHITECTURE.md`: This file seems to duplicate content in `DOCS/architecture/index.md`. Consider deprecating or merging.
- `DOCS/planning/`: Several SDDs referenced in `DOCS/index.md` were missing (`SDD_Unified_CLI_v2.md`, etc.). Removed links, but checks on planning docs might be needed.
