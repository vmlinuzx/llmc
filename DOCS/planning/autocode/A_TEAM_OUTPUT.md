# A-Team Output: Phase 2.3

**Phase:** 2.3 — Master Index
**Date:** 2025-12-16
**Author:** A-Team (Drafter)

## Work Completed

### 1. Requirements Definition
- Created `DOCS/planning/autocode/REQUIREMENTS.md` specifying acceptance criteria for the Master Index.

### 2. Documentation Updates
- **Modified:** `DOCS/index.md`
  - Rewrote introduction to be more welcoming.
  - Added explicit "Start Here" section.
  - Reorganized main sections to strictly follow Diátaxis categories (Tutorials, Guides, Ops, Reference, Explanation, Dev).
  - Updated descriptions for clarity.
  - Preserved "Quick Links" table with updated paths.
  - Added "Planning" section.

### 3. Terminology
- Standardized section names (Getting Started, User Guide, Operations, Architecture, Reference, Development).
- Used "Diátaxis" descriptors in sub-headers (e.g., "**Tutorials & Learning**").

## Artifacts
- `DOCS/index.md`
- `DOCS/planning/autocode/REQUIREMENTS.md`

## Notes for B-Team
- Verify all links in `DOCS/index.md` point to valid targets (some targets might be empty/placeholders if Phase 0 scaffolding was minimal, but paths match the SDD).
- The "Version" is hardcoded to `v0.7.0` based on the previous file content; ensure this is accurate.

SUMMARY: Rewrote DOCS/index.md as master entry point with Diátaxis structure, Start Here callout, and navigation links.
