# Legacy

This directory contains **deprecated or backup files** that are no longer part of the supported LLMC-6 runtime,
but are kept for reference while the system stabilizes.

- `tools_rag_service.py.backup` – older draft of the RAG service wiring. The live implementation is in `tools/rag/service.py`.

Nothing in `legacy/` is imported or executed by default. If you copy code out of here, treat it as **example only**
and bring it up to date with current patterns before use.
