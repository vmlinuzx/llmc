# Gap Analysis Report - 2025-12-18

**Agent:** Rem the Gap Analysis Demon

## Summary
Identified a complete lack of testing for the `ChangeQueue` class in `llmc/rag/watcher.py`, which is critical for file watching debounce logic and preventing index starvation.

## Gaps Identified

### 1. Coverage Gap: `ChangeQueue` Logic
- **Description:** No tests existed for the debouncing queue used by the RAG watcher.
- **SDD:** `tests/gap/SDDs/SDD-RAG-Watcher-ChangeQueue.md`
- **Status:** **Closed** (Tests implemented)
- **Target:** `tests/rag/test_watcher_queue.py`
- **Verification:** 6 tests passed, covering debounce, starvation, timeout, and thread safety.

## Actions Taken
- Created SDD defining the test strategy.
- Implemented `tests/rag/test_watcher_queue.py` with comprehensive unit tests using `unittest.mock`.
- Verified all tests pass.
