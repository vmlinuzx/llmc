## Verdict

**N/A - No Web UI Detected**

This project, `llmc`, has been identified as a command-line application and backend service. Analysis of the repository structure, Dockerfiles, and server implementation (`llmc_mcp/server.py`) confirms the absence of a web-based user interface.

The primary interface is a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a server that communicates via standard I/O (stdio), not HTTP. As such, web-based User Acceptance Testing (UAT) using browser automation tools is not applicable.
