# Rem's Gap Analysis Report: 2025-12-23

This report summarizes the gaps identified and actions taken on this date.

## 1. `mcgrep` CLI Test Coverage

- **Gap**: The `mcgrep` command-line tool had no dedicated test suite, posing a risk of undetected regressions in argument parsing, command logic, and error handling.
- **SDD**: [SDD-mcgrep-CLITestCoverage.md](../../gap/SDDs/SDD-mcgrep-CLITestCoverage.md)
- **Action**: Spawned a worker agent to implement a new test suite.
- **Status**: **COMPLETED**. The worker successfully created and validated `tests/cli/test_mcgrep.py`, which now provides comprehensive test coverage for the `mcgrep` CLI.
