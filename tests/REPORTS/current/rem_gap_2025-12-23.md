# Rem's Gap Analysis Report - 2025-12-23

## Summary
This report details the identified gaps in test coverage and security for the `llmc` repository. For each gap, a Software Design Document (SDD) was created and a worker agent was spawned to implement the corresponding test.

## Gaps Identified

### 1. Missing Test for `get_repo_stats` Success Path
- **Description**: The success path for `llmc.cli.get_repo_stats` was not covered by tests.
- **SDD**: [SDD-CLI-RepoStatsSuccess.md](tests/gap/SDDs/SDD-CLI-RepoStatsSuccess.md)
- **Status**: Worker agent spawned and completed implementation.

### 2. Incomplete Path Traversal Check in `route` Command
- **Description**: The security check for path traversal in the `route` command was naive and did not cover all attack vectors.
- **SDD**: [SDD-CLI-RoutePathTraversal.md](tests/gap/SDDs/SDD-CLI-RoutePathTraversal.md)
- **Status**: Worker agent spawned and completed implementation. The new test successfully identifies the vulnerability.

### 3. Missing Test Coverage for `DashboardState` Class
- **Description**: The `DashboardState` class, which drives the `monitor` TUI, had no test coverage for its state management logic.
- **SDD**: [SDD-CLI-DashboardStateCoverage.md](tests/gap/SDDs/SDD-CLI-DashboardStateCoverage.md)
- **Status**: Worker agent spawned and completed implementation.

### 4. Missing Test for `search` Command
- **Description**: The demo `search` command, an exposed CLI endpoint, had no test to ensure it runs without error.
- **SDD**: [SDD-CLI-SearchCommandCoverage.md](tests/gap/SDDs/SDD-CLI-SearchCommandCoverage.md)
- **Status**: Worker agent spawned and completed implementation.
