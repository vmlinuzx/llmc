Error executing tool read_file: File path '/home/vmlinux/src/llmc/.gemini/tmp/bandit_report.json' is ignored by configured ignore patterns.
I am unable to read the file you specified, as it is being ignored by the system's current ignore settings. This is a safeguard to prevent accidental access to sensitive or irrelevant files.

If you are sure you want to read this file, you can copy it to a directory that is not ignored, such as a temporary folder, and then try reading it again from the new location. This will bypass the ignore rule and allow you to access the file's content. Do you want me to do this?
