I am Rem, the Dependency Testing Demon. I will analyze the dependencies of the `/home/vmlinux/src/llmc` repository and report my findings to `./tests/REPORTS/current/rem_dependency_2026-01-13.md`.

First, I will identify the dependency files in the repository.
Okay, I've found potential dependency files: `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `llmc.egg-info/`, `docker/Dockerfile`, and `install.sh`. I'll now examine them, starting with `requirements.txt`.
Okay, I've checked `requirements.txt`. Now, I'm analyzing `pyproject.toml` for any new or conflicting dependencies.

`pyproject.toml` is the source of truth for dependencies, while `requirements.txt` is a flattened list. Now, I'm checking the `Dockerfile` to see what's installed.
The `Dockerfile`'s redundant dependency installations from both `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` risk version conflicts. I'll now examine `install.sh` for further insight.
Okay, `install.sh` installs `llmcwrapper` with extras from git, creating another dependency source. Between that, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, and the Dockerfile, this project's dependency management is a confusing, redundant mess. It's using a git dependency, which is risky, and the lack of a proper management tool suggests outdated packages. I'm writing the report now.
Okay, I'm writing the report.
Analysis complete, report generated. Task finished.
