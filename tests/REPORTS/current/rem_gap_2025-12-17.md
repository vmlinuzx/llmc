# Rem's Gap Analysis Report - 2025-12-17

This report summarizes the findings of a gap analysis performed on the `llmc` repository. The focus of this analysis was on the `llmc/security.py` module.

## 1. Summary of Gaps Found

Three primary gaps were identified in the test coverage for the `llmc.security.normalize_path` function:

1.  **Missing Null Byte Injection Test:** The function had a check for null bytes (`\x00`), but no test to verify it.
2.  **Missing Symlink Traversal Test:** The tests did not account for symbolic links that could be used to traverse outside the repository root.
3.  **Missing Complex Fuzzy Matching Test:** The fuzzy matching logic for finding files was not tested in scenarios with multiple files of the same name at different directory depths.

## 2. SDDs and Worker Status

For each identified gap, a Software Design Document (SDD) was created, and a worker agent was spawned to implement the corresponding test.

| Gap | SDD | Worker Status |
|---|---|---|
| Null Byte Injection | [SDD-Security-NullByteInjection.md](tests/gap/SDDs/SDD-Security-NullByteInjection.md) | Completed |
| Symlink Traversal | [SDD-Security-SymlinkTraversal.md](tests/gap/SDDs/SDD-Security-SymlinkTraversal.md) | Completed |
| Complex Fuzzy Matching | [SDD-Security-FuzzyMatching.md](tests/gap/SDDs/SDD-Security-FuzzyMatching.md) | Completed |

## 3. Conclusion

The identified gaps in test coverage for `llmc/security.py` have been successfully addressed. The new tests improve the security posture of the `normalize_path` function by ensuring it is robust against null byte injection, symlink traversal, and ambiguous fuzzy matching scenarios.
