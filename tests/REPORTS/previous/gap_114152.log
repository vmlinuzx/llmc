I will create the directories for the SDDs and reports as required by the gap analysis workflow.

Okay, directories are ready. I'll begin my analysis by listing Python files in `llmc/` and `tests/` to map the codebase and its test coverage.

Okay, too many files. I'll focus on `llmc/cli.py` and its tests, `tests/cli/test_cli.py`, since the CLI is critical and probably has coverage gaps. I'll read both to understand commands and existing tests.
## Analysis: `llmc/cli.py` & `tests/cli/test_cli.py`

`llmc/cli.py`'s `get_repo_stats` has multiple failure points (e.g., `load_status`, `_load_graph` failing) and placeholder logic. `DashboardState` manages TUI state, `make_layout` is presentation-only, and `search` is a demo. `monitor` is a TUI command driven by `DashboardState` and `get_repo_stats`, while `route` tests routing logic with a basic path traversal check.

`tests/cli/test_cli.py` covers `get_repo_stats`'s failure modes and `route`'s basic success, failure, and security paths.

## Gaps Found

1.  **Coverage Gap:** `get_repo_stats`'s success path, where dependencies return valid data, is untested.
2.  **Security Gap:** `route`'s path traversal check is insufficient, missing absolute and other complex traversal methods.
3.  **Coverage Gap:** The `monitor` command's driving class, `DashboardState`, is untested.
4.  **Coverage Gap (minor):** The `search` command, though a demo, has no test to ensure it doesn't crash.

I'll start by addressing the first gap: the missing success-path test for `get_repo_stats`. I will now create the SDD.
SDD created. Spawning worker agent.
Test implemented. Now, create After Action Report for today.
First cycle done. Now, for Gap 2: `route` command's incomplete path traversal. I'll write an SDD to add better tests for it.
Path traversal SDD done. Spawning worker.
Worker's test implemented, and it failed as expected, exposing a vulnerability. I won't fix it; my role is to ensure it's tested. Now, I'll update the report.
Updating the report.
Okay, third cycle: testing the `monitor` command. I'll focus on testing the `DashboardState` class, since the UI is tricky. I'm now writing the SDD for this.
`DashboardState` SDD is done. Spawning worker now.
`DashboardState` tests are done. Time to update the After Action Report.
Updating the report.
Third cycle done. Now to address the last `llmc/cli.py` gap: the `search` command lacks logic and a test. It's a minor point, but I'll write an SDD for a basic crash test.
Okay, SDD for `search` command coverage is done. Spawning a worker to implement it now.
Okay, worker implemented the `search` test. Updating the After Action Report now.
Okay, updating the report with the final `llmc/cli.py` entry.
Analyzed `llmc/cli.py`, identified and documented four gaps, assigned workers to create tests, and filed a final report. My work on this file is done; I await further instructions. I'm prepared to analyze other codebase sections.
I've finished the gap analysis of `llmc/cli.py`, creating SDDs, spawning test-writing agents, and reporting my findings. I'm ready for my next assignment.
Analysis of `llmc/cli.py` is complete and reported. Awaiting user instructions.
I have completed the gap analysis for `llmc/cli.py`. I have identified four gaps, created SDDs for each, spawned workers to implement the tests, and updated the final report.

My task is complete. I will await further instructions.
