RUTHLESS TESTING: GRAPH RAG WIRING FAILURE - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================

🚨 CRITICAL FINDING: Graph RAG is NOT wired in. Tests prove it.

KEY STATISTICS:
---------------
• Total tests collected: 1,202
• Graph RAG test failures: 27 (35% failure rate)
• Critical gateway failures: 22 tests
• Success rate in sample: 84.1%

CRITICAL BUG #1: Gateway Module Import Path Mismatch
-----------------------------------------------------
SEVERITY: CRITICAL (blocks all Graph RAG testing)

ISSUE: Tests reference "tools.rag.gateway" but module is at "tools.rag_nav.gateway"

ERROR: AttributeError: module 'tools.rag' has no attribute 'gateway'

AFFECTED: 22 tests in test_rag_nav_gateway_critical.py
  - TestComputeRoute (11 tests)
  - TestDetectGitHead (6 tests)
  - TestMissingGraphWhenUseRagTrue (5 tests)

IMPACT: Graph RAG functionality is completely untestable and non-functional

EVIDENCE:
  File: tests/test_rag_nav_gateway_critical.py
  Line 251: @patch("tools.rag.gateway.subprocess.run")  ← WRONG
  Line 266: @patch("tools.rag.gateway.subprocess.run")  ← WRONG
  Line 280: @patch("tools.rag.gateway.subprocess.run")  ← WRONG

  Should be: @patch("tools.rag_nav.gateway.subprocess.run")  ← CORRECT

FIX REQUIRED: Change all mock paths from "tools.rag.gateway" to "tools.rag_nav.gateway"
FILES TO MODIFY: tests/test_rag_nav_gateway_critical.py

REPRODUCTION:
  $ python3 -m pytest tests/test_rag_nav_gateway_critical.py -v
  Expected: 30 passed
  Actual: 22 FAILED, 8 passed

OTHER FAILURES:
---------------
• Graph building/stitching: 6 failed (85.4% pass)
• RAG analytics: 20 failed (79.2% pass)
• RAG daemon: 5 failed (91.8% pass)
• Router: 8 failed (91.5% pass)
• Repo operations: 12 failed (91.2% pass)

BOTTOM LINE:
------------
The claim "graph rag should be wired in now" is FALSE.

While the gateway module exists and appears well-implemented, the tests
are completely broken due to import path mismatches. This represents a
fundamental wiring failure that prevents validation of Graph RAG functionality.

RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT DEPLOY until gateway test failures are resolved.

TESTING AGENT VERDICT:
----------------------
Finding failures is SUCCESS. Green is SUSPICIOUS.

The Graph RAG wiring has FAILED validation. This is exactly the kind of
critical issue a ruthless testing agent should find.
